        "The FedEx Logistic Performance Analysis aimed to evaluate and enhance the efficiency of the logistics process by examining delivery performance, freight cost management, and vendor efficiency across multiple regions. Using a comprehensive dataset, the project identified critical areas of improvement and provided actionable recommendations to optimize operations and reduce costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Preparation and Cleaning\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset encompassed key variables such as \"Country,\" \"Vendor,\" \"Is On-Time Delivery,\" \"Freight Cost (USD),\" and \"Weight (Kilograms).\" Significant data cleaning efforts included addressing missing values in the \"Weight (Kilograms)\" column, where 3,742 null entries were filled with country-specific mean weights. This approach preserved regional accuracy and ensured the integrity of subsequent analyses.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Delivery Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Vendor Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Over 70% of vendors maintained a 100% on-time delivery rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Underperforming vendors, such as \"SCMS from RDC,\" exhibited delivery rates as low as 47.22%, impacting regional reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regional Delays:\n",
        "\n",
        "Countries like Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire faced significant delays, necessitating region-specific interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Freight Cost Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Weight Category Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "Shipments in the \"500-1000\" weight range were identified as the most cost-efficient, with an average freight cost of 6,771 USD.\n",
        "\n",
        "Small shipments (\"0-500\" weight range) incurred higher average costs of 8,345 USD, while shipments above 10,000 kilograms had the highest average cost at 31,652 USD.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regional Cost Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "Cameroon and Nigeria emerged as high-cost regions, indicating opportunities for renegotiation and operational improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Correlation Between Weight and Delays:\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis revealed a direct correlation between shipment weight and delivery delays, with heavier shipments experiencing more frequent delays. This insight emphasized the need for improved logistics for high-weight shipments."
